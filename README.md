# Count-number-of-faces
This project aims at counting the number of faces, detected in a proper lighted room, using the default camera of the device where the code is being executed. It requires the use of the python modules opencv, numpy (not explicitly used) and dlib.
Some issues may be faced while trying to install dlib using pip, in the terminal. So, here I am providing an YouTube link that can help with the installation processes:
