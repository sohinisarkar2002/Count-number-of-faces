# Count-number-of-faces
This project aims at counting the number of faces, detected in a properly lighted room, using the default camera of the device where the code is being executed. It requires the use of the Python modules - OpenCV, NumPy (not explicitly used), and Dlib.
Some issues may be faced while installing dlib using pip, in the terminal. So, here I am providing a YouTube link that can help with the installation processes:
